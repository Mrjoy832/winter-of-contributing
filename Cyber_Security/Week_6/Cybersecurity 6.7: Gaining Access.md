An organisation’s IT system refers to the collection of network devices, [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)), routers,[firewalls](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/products/security/firewalls/what-is-a-firewall.html#:~:text=A%20firewall%20is%20a%20network,security%20for%20over%2025%20years.&text=A%20firewall%20can%20be%20hardware%2C%20software%2C%20or%20both.) and other devices that form a computer network important for employee of the organisation to work smoothly on their respective systems or machines. **Penetration testing is performed on this IT system to evaluate the security  of the system to the organisation in an ethical way as compared to hacking which is unethical**.

Pentest helps an organization to secure the sensitive data of customers. It also helps an organization avoid embarrassment and loss of reputation in case of disclosure of sensitive information in the public domain on account of security breach or hacking. **Penetration testing is divided into 5 steps:**

1. Reconnaissance 
2. Scanning 
3. Gaining Access 
4. Maintaining Access
5. Covering Track

Out of this,**_gaining access_** can be accomplished with various methods and tools based on the information received from Reconnaissance and scanning of the network. Hence it is one of the hardest part of penetration testing as one type of problem can be solved using multiple methods and it is our duty as a penetrator to find the optimized solution. Let’s understand more about this

### Gaining Access
---

It is a phase where the attacker/penetrator obtains control of the network of the target. To conduct this operation penetrators has to run exploits only when there is no shadow of doubt about the vulnerability existing on the target system.

#### What is an exploit?

In terms of our IT system, an exploit can be described as a small piece of malicious code that gains from the advantages of the vulnerability to cause unintended behavior in the system.  While discussing this topic where do we get this exploits from or how do we create one. **Creating an exploit is like creating your own virus** kind off a strategy but incase we want some general exploits then they are:
* Generally found on public domains such as http://www.exploit-db.com/
* Some organisations build these exploits only to be used for companies that ask them to provide them with services under the terms of the legal agreement.
* Some exploits are sold on the dark web and nobody knows how it is going to be used and to what extent.

To exploit the current IT system, three method are conducted majorly:

These methods attached with _password cracking, man-in-the-middle attack,phishing attacks etc._ could lead to major loses when incurred by a large organisation. Thus it is extremely important to find the vulnerabilities of the syste before the hacker does.

### Tops tools used to gain access of the system.

1. **XRAY**: [XRAY](https://github.com/evilsocket/xray) is excellent network mapping tool that uses **OSNIT framework** to implement its tactics. It used wordlist,[DNS request](https://www.varonis.com/blog/dns-tunneling/) and an API key to help identify open ports on a network. It supports Linux and Window Systems

2. **Wireshark**:It is the most widely used network protocol analyzer tool across the world. Network traffic log generated by [Wireshark](https://www.varonis.com/blog/dns-tunneling/) can help determined what protocols and systems are live, what accounts are most active and what are the loopholes in Horizontal elevation and vertical elevation that helps attacker access the sensitive data from the compromised machine.

3. **Aircrack-ng**: It is an all in package for penetration testing [Aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng) tops the list due to its features such as it does monitoring of network packets, attacking via packet injection, testing of WiFi capabilities, and finally, password cracking. 
4. **Metasploit**: [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) started as an open source solution and over the course of years it has accomplished tasks such as vulnerability scanning, listening, exploiting known vulnerabilities, evidence collection, and project reporting. 
5. **Fuzzdb**: It contains pre-built attack payloads to run against web applications to discover if vulnerabilities are genuinely exploitable. [Fuzzdb](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb) can run discovery scans and perform analysis on the responses received from these scans to narrow better the focus of where vulnerabilities exist.
6. **[NMAP](https://nmap.org/)**: It is a network mapping tool powerpack with its Zenmap GUI that helps to find vulnerable network ports and compare the scan results to provide the exact places at which the organisation is lagging in security.

### Conclusion
---

Hence it is extremely important for security officials to check all the possible vulnerabilities of the system and provide a long term and safe solution if needed. Otherwise it becomes very easy for the hacker to gain access to the system, illegally corrupt the system,database and the network of the IT system that might lead to organization incurring heavy losses within a span of breach.
