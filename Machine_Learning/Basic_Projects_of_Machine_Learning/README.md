  <p align = 'justify'>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) projects are becoming increasingly attractive in national and international companies. However, the effort involved often is underestimated, while the outcomes achieved by a project of this kind could be overestimated because of unrealistic expectations. In the worst case, the feasibility of an ML model cannot be sufficiently proven by a prototype. However, if you think that the expenses and work done so far would have been useless, you are mistaken. In this article, we will show you the advantages of machine learning projects and why it is worthwhile - apart from the actual project goal - to start an AI project in your company.</p>
