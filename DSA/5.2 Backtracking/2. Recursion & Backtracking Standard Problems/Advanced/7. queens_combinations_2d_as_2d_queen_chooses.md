<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Explanation: </b></i>

You are given a number n, representing the size of a n * n chess board.

You are required to calculate and print the combinations in which n queens can be placed on the n * n chess-board.

Note, in this problem, you can have any queen in any of the cells, i.e. you are not taking into consideration whether the queens can kill each other or not.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach : </b></i>

We have already learnt how to generate combinations of identical items in a 1d array by taking levels as items (in increasing order only) and choices as selecting an empty box.

In this problem, we are given the queens as identical items, and there is a slight variation that instead of 1d array of boxes, we are given a 2d array/grid of the chessboard.

So, we will take the queens (in increasing order only) as the levels in the recursion tree, and the choice/edge will be selecting an empty cell after the last queen's cell.

Isn't it simple? 

Just replace the traversal over 1d array for selecting an empty box to traversal over 2d array for selecting an empty cell. But, please be careful that we need to traverse through the cells only after the last queen's cell (to avoid permutations).

Hence, we will skip all the rows less than the last queen's row, and also skip all the cells in the left of the last queen's row.

Thus, we will traverse through the cells in the ith row to the right of last queen's cell and all the cells in the bottom rows.

Please note what should be the base case of this problem?

<i><b>Base case </b></i>can be considered when we have made a decision for all of the queens, i.e. the queens placed so far (qpsf) is equal to the total number of queens available (n or tq). When we hit the base case, we will print the grid, by writing the 'q' for filled cells, else print '-' followed by tab space for the empty cell.

```
import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void queensCombinations(int qpsf, int tq, boolean[][] chess, int i, int j) {
    if (qpsf == tq) {
      for (int row = 0; row < chess.length; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col < chess.length; col++) {
          System.out.print(chess[row][col] ? "q	" : "-	");
        }
        System.out.println();
      }
      System.out.println();
      return;
    }

    for (int row = i; row < chess.length; row++) {
      for (int col = (row == i ? j + 1 : 0);
           col < chess.length; col++) {
        if (chess[row][col] == false) {
          chess[row][col] = true;
          queensCombinations(qpsf + 1, tq, chess, row, col);
          chess[row][col] = false;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    boolean[][] chess = new boolean[n][n];

    queensCombinations(0, n, chess, 0, -1);
  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Explanation: </b></i>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity: </b></i>

In the recursion tree, we are having queens as levels, and the choices as selecting an empty box. Since levels are n (queens) and the total cells (choices) are n^2, hence the total time complexity will be O(n^2 * n^2 * .... n times) = O(n2n)

<i><b>Space Complexity: </b></i>

Since, the maximum depth of recursion is equal to the number of queens = n, hence the space complexity will be O(n), as recursion takes function call stack space.

We hope that you understood the concept successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://youtu.be/zOmrEPnrrJQ).
