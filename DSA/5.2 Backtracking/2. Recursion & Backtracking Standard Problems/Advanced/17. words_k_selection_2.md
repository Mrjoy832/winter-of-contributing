<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Understanding the problem: </b></i>

In this problem you are given a word (may have one character repeat more than once) and an integer k.

All you need to do is generate and print all ways you can select k distinct characters out of the word.

<i><b>Sample Input: </b></i>
```
aabbbcc
2
```
<i><b>Sample Output: </b></i>
```
ab ac bc
(in different lines)
```

<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>How? </b></i>

<i><b>Given Word: </b></i>aabbbcc

<i><b>K: </b></i>2

So we had to generate all ways in which 2 distinct characters can be selected. And all such ways can be seen in the sample output.

For more clarity of the question; watch this part of the [video](https://youtu.be/fy5mFaHVuRs).

<i><b>Moving On: </b></i>

Let us go through the rules again:
All characters should be distinct.
K distinct characters should be selected.

We will solve this question through <i><b>recursion: </b></i>

We have n options to explore where n represents the number of distinct characters.

Each nth level of the recursion deals with the placement of unique characters at index greater than the index of last placed element in the nth slot.

<i><b>Base Case: </b></i>
When the level crosses the value of k

Let's try to draw the recursion tree for an input, aabbbcc keeping the above points into consideration:

At level-1, we have we have three options, we can choose a, b or c. Rest of the work is passed to Level-2.

At level-2, we have 2 ways to further explore a. It can either choose to be with b or c. Then we move to b, we have only one way to explore b, that is by appending c with it. Then we move to c, it has no option. And pass the rest of the work to level-3.

At level-3, we have crossed the value k (2) so we have no more options to explore as there are only 2 slots available. Since each level corresponds to filling each slot, we have already dealt with both the spots in previous levels. So here, we simply print the obtained answers.

<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Signature of the function: </b></i>
```
public static void generateSelection(String ustr, int cs, int ts, int lc, String asf)
```
<i><b>ustr: </b></i>unique string; contains all the distinct characters of the input string.
 
Using a hashset, all the unique values are collected from the input string and then using a for loop on the hashset, all the values are stored in a string, ustr. This has been already done for us in the main.

<i><b>cs: </b></i>current selection; stores the count of characters selected so far in asf.

<i><b>ts: </b></i>total selections; its value is initialized with k and it remains fix.

<i><b>ts: </b></i>total selections; its value is initialized with k and it remains fix.

<i><b>lc: </b></i>(last choice) initialized with -1, represents last index which of the character which used.

<i><b>asf: </b></i>answer so far; string type. Stores the answer explored till this point. Updated it at each level by appending a character from ustr.

Let's try to code this!

<i style="text-decoration: underline"><b>
Code Explained: </b></i>

Initially lc is -1, cs is 0 and asf is an empty string.

Then we use a for loop to explore the characters which occurs after lc till the length of ustr in ustr. And append this character in the asf, put i as lc and increment cs as one character has been added to asf.

For the base case we check if cs has crossed ts, if it has then it means we have selected an element for each position.

Then we print the asf and finally return.

    for (int i = lc + 1; i < ustr.length(); i++) {
      generateSelection(ustr, cs + 1, ts, i, asf +
                        ustr.charAt(i));
    }
  } public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { BufferedReader
    br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String str = br.readLine();
    int
    k = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    HashSet unique = new HashSet<>();
    String ustr = "";
    for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
      if (unique.contains(ch) == false) {
        unique.add(ch);
        ustr += ch;
      }
    }

    generateSelection(ustr, 1, k, -1, "");
  }
}
```
