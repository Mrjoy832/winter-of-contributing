<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Understanding the problem:</b></i>

In this problem you are given an integer n which represents size of the array and then n numbers more that represents n distinct integers of the array and an integer k.

All you have to do is divide these n integers into k non - empty subsets such that the sum of integers of every subset is the same. If it is not possible to divide then print "-1".

<i><b>Sample Output: </b></i>
```
[1, 6] [2, 5] [3, 4]
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>How ?</b></i>

As the given input implies that n = 6, array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and k = 3, which means we have to partition 6 elements of the array (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) in 3 subsets such that sum of each subset is equal. 

So there is only one way to do so which is shown in the output ([1, 6] [2, 5] [3, 4]).
Here also remember that you can't print permutations. Like ([6, 1] [2, 5] [3, 4]) is one of the possible permutations for the given output.

And there can be no empty sets. So any answer with an empty set is an invalid option for output.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Moving On: </b></i>

Let us go through the rules again:

Permutation in the partition is not allowed within the set and of the sets. For example if [1, 2][3] is an answer, then we would not consider [2, 1][3] as a different answer and neither [3][1, 2].

We must divide n into k sets (no empty set is allowed).
Sum of all the elements of each subset should be equal.

We will solve this question through recursion and backtracking:

We will have two options - whether to form a new group with the current n or to place n in any already present group.
If there are many empty groups, we will place n only in one new group (to avoid permutation).

Some of the special cases (Thankfully! already handled in the code):

If (k > n); Ways of partitioning in this case is zero (Example: n = 2, k = 3, we cannot divide 2 elements in 3 sets, therefore print -1.

If (k = 1); Ways of partitioning in this case is one.
If (sum % k != 0); Ways of partitioning the sets with equal sum in this case is 0.

Let's try to draw the recursion tree for n = 3 and k = 2 before moving to the code, keeping the above points into consideration:

At level-1, we have two sets and both of them are empty. So we have only one way to add 1, which is we add 1 to one empty set and pass the rest of the work to level-2.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/k-subsets-with-equal-sum/k_subsets_with_squal_sum_1.png">

At level-2, we have two sets and out of which one set is non empty (contains 1) and the second one is empty. So we have two ways to add 2, which is we either add 2 to the non empty set (with 1) or to the empty set and pass the rest of the work to level-3.

At level-3, we have two options to explore; first is if 3 is added to the option when 2 was added to the non empty set. In this case, we have two sets and out of which one set is non empty (contains 1 and 2) and the second one is empty. 

So we have two ways to add 3, which is we either add 3 to the non empty set (with 1 and 2) or to the empty set. And in the second option; we have two sets as well and both of them are non empty, one contains 1 and another contains 2. 

So we have two ways to add 3 which is we either add 3 to the first non empty set (with 1) or to the second non empty set (with 2) and pass the rest of work to level-4.

At level-4, we have no more options to explore as n is 3 and we already dealt with all 3 elements of the array in previous levels. 

So here, we check which of the possible answers is valid. First answer is invalid because one set is empty in this answer which violates one of the rules. 

Next answer does not violate any rule and the sum of each subset is equal to (i.e. 3) therefore this is a valid answer. Next two answers are also invalid as the sum of subsets varies in both cases.

    }
  }
}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Code Explained:</b></i>

Initially vidx is 0, ssssf is 0 and ans is an empty arraylist of size k.

If (n - 1) elements can be divided into k sets, then the nth element can join any of the kth sets. If n-1 elements can be divided into k - 1 sets, then the nth element only has one choice and that is to make a new set.

We have to consider two cases at every level: Case 1: to make a new set. Case 2: to add the current element to any of the already present sets.

We use a FOR loop at every level. If the size of the ArrayList for the jth set is zero, it means that jth set is empty, then we add arr[vidx] to that set (make a new set) and add this value in the current value at jth index of subsetSum array and finally break out of the loop as size of all the set after that will be zero and to avoid permutations, we break (Case 1). 

As the number of sets is increased in this case, therefore, we will increase ssssf in this case.

If the size of the jth set is not zero, we add arr[vidx] to that set and add this value in the current value at jth index of subsetSum array. (Case2). 

As the number of sets remains constant, we would not increase ssssf.

In pre-order we add the arr[vidx] to the jth set and also add this value in the current value at jth index of subsetSum array and in post-order we remove it and subtract this value in the current value at jth index of subsetSum array.

For the base case we check if vidx equals n, if it does then it means we have placed all the elements of the array in some subset. 

Then we will check if ssssf is equal to the k, this condition filters out the answers with an empty set.

Then we check if the sum of each subset is equal or not by capturing the subsetSum at 0 index, and initializing a Boolean flag to true and finally applying a for loop on the rest of the subsetSum array to check whether same value is present at each index or not.

If any value is different then we set the value of flag to false and we come out of the loop using break keyword.
After coming out of the for loop, we check if the value of flag is true or false. 

If it's true then we will print the answer in the required format and finally return.
