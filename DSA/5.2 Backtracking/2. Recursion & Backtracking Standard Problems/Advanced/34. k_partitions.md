<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Understanding The Problem: </b></i>

In this problem you are given an integer n and k, where n represents number of elements and k represents number of subsets.

All you have to do is to partition n elements in k subsets and print all such configurations.

<i><b>Sample Input: </b></i>3
2

<i><b>Sample Output: </b></i>1. [1, 2] [3]
1. [1, 3] [2]
2. [1] [2, 3]

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>How? </b></i>

As the given input implies that n = 3 and k = 2, which means we have to partition 3 elements (1, 2, 3) in 2 subsets. So there are 3 ways to do so which are shown in output.

Also remember that you can't print permutations. Like [2,1][3], [3][1,2] and [3][2,1] are the possible permutations for the first output i.e. [1,2][3].
And there can be no empty sets. Like [1, 2, 3][-] is an invalid option for output.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach: </b></i>

<i><b>Moving On </b></i>

Let us go through the rules again:
Permutation in the partition is not allowed within the set and of the sets. 

For example if [1,2][3] is an answer, then we would not consider [2,1][3] as a different answer and neither [3][1.2].

We must divide n into k sets (no empty set is allowed).

We will solve this question through recursion and backtracking:

We will have two options - whether to form a new group with the current n or to place n in any already present group.

If there are many empty groups, we will place n only in one new group (to avoid permutation).

<b>Some of the base cases:</b>

If (k > n); Ways of partitioning in this case is zero (Example - n = 2, k = 3, we cannot divide 2 elements in 3 sets, therefore the answer will be 0).

If (k = n); Ways of partitioning in this case is 1 (Example - n = 2, k = 2. We can form only one valid case: [1][2].

If (n = 0 || k = 0); Ways of partitioning in this case is 0.

If (k = 1): Ways of partitioning in this case is one.

Let's try to draw the recursion tree for n = 3 and k = 2, keeping the above points into consideration:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/k_partitions/k_partitions_1.png">

At level-1, we have three sets and all of those are empty. So we have only one way to add 1, which is we add 1 to one empty set and pass the rest of the work to level-2.

At level-2, we have two sets and out of which one set is non empty (contains 1) and the second one is empty. So we have two ways to add 2, which is we either add 2 to the non empty set (with 1) or to the empty set and pass the rest of the work to level-3.

At level-3, we have two options to explore; first is if 3 is added to the option when 2 was added to the non empty set.

In this case, we have two sets and out of which one set is non empty (contains 1 and 2) and the second one is empty. So we have two ways to add 3, which is we either add 3 to the non empty set (with 1 and 2) or to the empty set.

And in the second option; we have two sets as well and both of them are non empty, one contains 1 and another contains 2. So we have two ways to add 3 which is we either add 3 to the first non empty set (with 1) or to the second non empty set (with 2) and pass the rest of work to level-4.

At level-4, we have no more options to explore as n is 3 and we already dealt with 3 in previous level. So here, we check which of the possible answers is valid. First answer is invalid because one set is empty in this answer which violates one of the rules. Rest other answers do not violate any rule therefore they all are valid.

At level-4, we have no more options to explore as n is 3 and we already dealt with 3 in previous level. So here, we check which of the possible answers is valid. First answer is invalid because one set is empty in this answer which violates one of the rules. Rest other answers do not violate any rule therefore they all are valid.

Let's draw the recursion tree for n = 4 and k = 3 before moving to the code, just like we did for n =3 and k = 2:

At level-1, we have three sets and all of them are empty. So we have only one way to add 1, which is we add 1 to one empty set and pass the rest of the work to level-2.

At level-2, we have three sets and out of which one set is non empty (contains 1) and other two are empty. So we have two ways to add 2, which is we either add 2 to the non empty set (with 1) or to one of the empty sets and pass the rest of the work to level-3.

At level-3, we have two options to explore; first is if 3 is added to the option when 2 was added to the non empty set.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/k_partitions/k_partitions_2.png">

In this case, we have three sets and out of which one set is non empty (contains 1 and 2) and other two sets are empty. 

So we have two ways to add 3, which is we either add 3 to the non empty set (with 1 and 2) or to one of the empty sets.

And in the second option; we have three sets as well and both of them are non empty, one contains 1 and another contains 2. 

So we have three ways to add 3 which are adding 3 to the first non empty set (with 1) or to the second non empty set (with 2) or to the third empty; then pass the rest of work to level-4.

At level-4, we have five options to explore. In the first case, we have three sets and out of which one set is non empty (contains 1, 2 and 3) and the other two sets are empty. So we have two ways to add 4, which is we either add 4 to the non empty set (with 1, 2 and 3) or to one of the empty sets.

In the second option; we have three sets as well and two out of them are non empty, one contains 1 and 2 and another contains 3. 

So we have three ways to add 4 which are adding 4 to the first non empty set (with 1 and 2) or to the second non empty set (with 3) or to the third empty set.

In the third option; we have three sets as well and two out of them are non empty, one contains 1 and 3 and another contains 2. 

So we have three ways to add 4 which are adding 4 to the first non empty set (with 1 and 3) or to the second non empty set (with 2) or to the third empty set.

In the fourth option; we have three sets as well and two out of them are non empty, one contains 1 and another contains 2 and 3. 

So we have three ways to add 4 which are adding 4 to the first non empty set (with 1) or to the second non empty set (with 2 and 3) or to the third empty set.

In the fifth option; we have three sets as well and all of them are non empty, the first one contains 1, the second one contains 2 and the third one contains 3. 

So we have three ways to add 4 which are adding 4 to the first non empty set (with 1) or to the second non empty set (with 2) or to the third non empty set (with 3); then pass the rest of the work to level-4.

At level-5, we have no more options to explore as n is 4 and we already dealt with 4 in previous level. 

So here, we check which of the possible answers is valid. An answer is invalid if even one set is empty; which violates one of the rules. If answers do not violate any rule then they are valid.

```
public static void solution (int i, int n, int k, int rssf, ArrayList & lt; ArrayList ans >)

<i><b>i: </b></i>current level

<i><b>n: </b></i>total levels

<i><b>rssf: </b></i>count of relevant sets so far. It stores the count of sets that have been filled so far.

<i><b>K: </b></i>number of sets that we want.

<i><b>ans: </b></i>ArrayList of size k that stores the answer till that level.

Let's try to code this!

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/k_partitions/k_partitions_2.png">

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Code Explained! </b></i>

Initially i is 0, rssf is 0 and ans is an empty arraylist of size k.

If (n - 1) elements can be divided into k sets, then the nth element can join any of the kth sets. 

If n-1 elements can be divided into k - 1 sets, then the nth element only has one choice and that is to make a new set.

We have to consider two cases at every level:

<i><b>Case 1: </b></i>to make a new set.

<i><b>Case 2: </b></i>to add the current element to any of the already present sets.

We use a FOR loop at every level. If the size of the ArrayList for the jth set is zero, it means that jth set is empty, then we add i to that set (make a new set) and break out of the loop as size of all the set after that will be zero and to avoid permutations, we break (Case 1). 

As the number of sets is increased in this case, therefore, we will increase rssf in this case.

If the size of the jth set is not zero, we add i to that set (Case2). As the number of sets remains constant, we would not increase rssf.

In pre-order we add the i to the jth set and in post-order we remove it.
For the base case we check if i is greater than n, it means we have placed all the elements. 

Then we will check if rssf is equal to the k, we will print the answer in the required format. We will return after that.

        counter++;

        ans.get(j).add(i);
        solution(i + 1, n, k, rssf + 1, ans);
        ans.get(j).remove(ans.get(j).size() - 1);
        break;
      } else {
        ans.get(j).add(i);
        solution(i + 1, n, k, rssf, ans);
        ans.get(j).remove(ans.get(j).size() - 1);
      }
    }

  }
