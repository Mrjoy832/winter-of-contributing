<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Explanation: </b></i>

You are given a number n, representing the size of a n * n chess board.

You are required to calculate and print the permutations in which n queens can be placed on the n * n chess-board.

Note, in this problem, you can have any queen in any of the cells, i.e. you are not taking into consideration whether the queens can kill each other or not.

Example:

<i><b>Input: </b></i>Number of queens (n) = 2

<i><b>Output: </b></i>

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach : </b></i>

We have already learnt how to generate permutations of non-identical items in a 1d array by taking levels as items and choices/edges as one of the empty boxes.

In this problem, we are given the queens as non-identical items, and there is a slight variation that instead of 1d array of boxes, we are given a 2d array/grid of the chessboard.

So, we will take the queens as the levels in the recursion tree, and the choice/edge will be choosing an empty cell of the grid.

So, isn't it simple? Instead of traversing through a 1d array, we need to traverse through the 2d array to find all the empty boxes and generate the permutations by placing the current queen in them.

Please note what should be the base case of this problem?

Base case can be considered when we have made a decision for all of the queens, i.e. the queens placed so far (qpsf) is equal to the total number of queens available (n or tq). When we hit the base case, we will print the grid, by appending the 'q' letter in front of the queen's item number, else print '-' followed by tab space for the empty cell.

import java.io.*;

import java.util.*;

public class Main {

  public static void queensPermutations(int qpsf, int tq, int[][] chess) {
    if (qpsf == tq) {
      for (int row = 0; row < chess.length; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col < chess.length; col++) {
          System.out.print(chess[row][col] != 0
                           ? "q" + chess[row][col] + "	" : "-	");
        }
        System.out.println();
      }
      System.out.println();
      return;
    }

    for (int row = 0; row < chess.length; row++) {
      for (int col = 0; col < chess.length; col++) {
        if (chess[row][col] == 0) {
          chess[row][col] = qpsf + 1;
          queensPermutations(qpsf + 1, tq, chess);
          chess[row][col] = 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
    int[][] chess = new int[n][n];

    queensPermutations(0, n, chess);
  }
}

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity: </b></i>

In the recursion tree, we are having queens as levels, and the choices as selecting a cell in the grid. Since queens are n and the total cells are n^2, hence the total time complexity will be O(n^2 * n^2 * .... n times) = O(n2n)

<i><b>Space Complexity: </b></i>

Since, the maximum depth of recursion is equal to the number of queens = n, hence the space complexity will be O(n), as recursion takes function call stack space.

We hope that you understood the concept successfully. In case you still face any difficulties in the solution for the problem, you may visit the complete solution [video](https://youtu.be/mkl6KOwtdbk).
