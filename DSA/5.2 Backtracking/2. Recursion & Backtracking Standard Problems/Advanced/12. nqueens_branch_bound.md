<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Understanding the problem:</b></i>

In this problem you are given a number n, the size of a chess board. You are required to place n number of queens in the n * n cells of board such that no queen can kill another, by completing the body of "printNQueens()" function - without changing signature - to calculate and print all safe configurations of n-queens.

<i><b>Note:</b></i>

<i><b>Queens Kill at distance in all 8 directions</b></i>

The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of the question is.
Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion, branch and bound technique and not test you.

<i><b>Sample Input:</b></i> 4

<i><b>Sample Output: </b></i>0-1, 1-3, 2-0, 3-2.0-2, 1-0, 2-3, 3-1.

The input is 4, which implies that (n=4), the size of a chess board is 4. We need to place 4 queens in the 4*4 cells of board such that no queen can kill each other.

There are 2 ways to place the 4 queens in 4*4 cells of board.
First way is represented by green circle (* sign), when queens are placed at 0-1, 1-3, 2-0, 3-2.

Second way is represented by red circle (# sign), when queens are placed at 0-2, 1-0, 2-3, 3-1.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Moving On:</b></i>

First of all, let's go through the rules of queen movement in chess:

She can move horizontally.

She can move vertically.

She can move diagonally in both directions.

Like previously, we will be solving this with recursion but with a new and better way.

At each level of recursion, we will increase the current row. We do not need to check the row as at each row only one queen can be placed. To check for columns and diagonals, we will create three new Boolean array:

Cols(column) array to check whether the current column is occupied by any other queen or not. If it is, we cannot place our queen on that column. Its size will be equal to N as there are N columns.

Ndaig(normal) array to check whether the current normal diagonal is occupied or not. If it is, we cannot place our queen on that box. Its size will be equal to 2*N - 1 as there are 2 * N - 1 diagonals in N X N board.

Rdiag(reverse) array to check whether the current reverse diagonal is occupied or not. If it is, we cannot place our queen on that box. Its size will be equal to 2*N - 1 as there are 2 * N - 1 diagonals in N X N board.

Let the n be 4.

Here every box is filled with the sum of row index and col index.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/n_queens_branch_and_bound/n_queens_branch_and_bound_2.png">

Thus, we can see that every line represents the same number and they represent the normal diagonal. Therefore, the size of ndiag is 2*N - 1.
Therefore, the element with index (0,1) will be represented as the 1st index of the ndiag array. If there is a queen on (0,1) then no queen can be placed on (1,0) too, therefore my marking 1st index of ndiag we are restricting any other queen on (1,0) too.
Similarly, by marking any index of ndiag as true, we are restricting any other queen on the same diagonal.
RDIAG
Here every element is filled with the difference of row and col index.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/n_queens_branch_and_bound/n_queens_branch_and_bound_3.png">

hus, we can see that every line represents the same item and they represent the reverse diagonal. As the number of lines is 2*N - 1. Therefore, the size of reverse diagonal is 2*N - 1.
As we cannot represent negative numbers as index of an array therefore we will add N - 1 to every element of 2D array to bring it in range of [0,2*N-1].
New 2D array:

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/n_queens_branch_and_bound/n_queens_branch_and_bound_4.png">

Therefore, the element with index (0,1) will be represented as the 2nd index of ndiag. If there is a queen on (0,1) then no queen can be placed on (1,2) and (2,3) too, therefore my marking 2nd index of rdiag we are restricting any queen on (1,2) and (2,3) too.
Similarly, by marking any index of rdiag as true, we are restricting any other queen on the same diagonal.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/n_queens_branch_and_bound/n_queens_branch_and_bound_5.png">

This array shows that index 2 of ndiag is storing the value for (2,0), (1,1) and (0,2) elements of the matrix.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Signature of the function: </b></i>
```
public static void solution(boolean[][] board, int row, boolean[] cols, boolean[] ndiag, boolean[] rdiag, String asf)
```

<i><b>board -</b></i> N X N board. It is marked as true wherever the queen is placed.

<i><b>row -</b></i> current row.

<i><b>cols - </b></i>array of size N. It is used to keep a tab of columns that are already occupied by the queen placed before the current queen.

<i><b>ndiag - </b></i>array of size 2 * N - 1. It is used to keep a tab of normal diagonals that are already occupied by the queen placed before the current queen.

<i><b>rdiag - </b></i>array of size 2 * N - 1. It is used to keep a tab of reverse diagonals that are already occupied by the queen placed before the current queen.

<i><b>asf - </b></i>string to store the positions where queens are placed.

Let's try to code this!

```
import java.util.*;


public class Main {

  public static void solution(boolean[][] board, int row, boolean[] cols, boolean[] ndiag
                              , boolean[] rdiag, String asf) {
    if (row == board.length) {
      System.out.println(asf + ".");
      return;
    }

    for (int col = 0; col < board.length; col++) {
      if (!cols[col] && !ndiag[row + col] && !rdiag[row - col + board.length - 1]) {
        board[row][col] = true;
        cols[col] = true;
        ndiag[row + col] = true;
        rdiag[row - col + board.length - 1] = true;
        solution(board, row + 1, cols, ndiag, rdiag, asf + row + "-" + col + ", ");
        board[row][col] = false;
        cols[col] = false;
        ndiag[row + col] = false;
        rdiag[row - col + board.length - 1] = false;
      }
    }
  }
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Code Explained: </b></i>

At each level of recursion, we will:

use a for loop to go through every column.
If the cols[col] == false and rdiag[row - col + N - 1] == false && ndiag[col + row] == false ,it means that there is no other queen that can kill the current queen .Therefore, we will place our queen on that box and mark the cols[col] , rdiag[ row - col + N - 1] and ndiag[col+ row] as true in preorder(VISIT).

We will then make a call for the next row.

We will unvisit the visited cols, rdiag and ndiag in post order and mark cols[col], ndiag[row+col] and rdiag[row - col + N - 1] as false.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Base Case: </b></i>

When the row will be equal to the length of board, we will print our asf and return.
