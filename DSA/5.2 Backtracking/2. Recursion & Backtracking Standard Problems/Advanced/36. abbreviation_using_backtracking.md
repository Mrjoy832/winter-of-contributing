<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Understanding the problem:</b></i>

You are given a word.
You have to generate all abbreviations of that word.

For example:

<i><b>Sample Input : </b></i>
```
pep
```

<i><b>Sample Output : </b></i>
```<i>
pep   pe1  p1p   p2   1ep  1e1  2p 3 (in different lines)
```
<i><b>Question Link : </b></i>[Click](https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-java-levelup/recursion-and-backtracking/abbreviation-suing-backtracking-official/ojquestion).

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>How?</b></i>

First of all, generate all the binaries of the length equal to the length of the input string.

<i><b>Binaries - </b></i>

000 -> pep

001 -> pe1
010 -> p1p

011 -> p2

100 -> 1ep

101 -> 1e1

110 -> 2p

111 -> 3

We can observe that whenever the bit is OFF (zero), we will use the character of the string at that position and whenever the bit is ON (one), we will count all the ON (one) bits that are together and then replace them with the count of the ON (one) bits.

The number of abbreviations will be equal to 2^n, where n = length of the string (as the number of binaries with given n is equal to 2^n ).

In the above example n = 3, therefore the number of abbreviations will be 8 (2^3 = 8).

We can see that this question is like the subsequence problem, we must maintain one more variable which will count the characters that were not included in the subsequence.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach:</b> </i>

Let's try to draw the recursion tree diagram for the word, "pep". In recursion diagram, (a | b | c) a represents the test string, b represents the answer so far and c represents the count.

<img src="https://pepvids.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/articles/abbreviations_using_backtracking%20/abbreviation_using_backtracking_1.png">

In the above diagram, (pep|.|0) has two options, either it can include the first p in the answer or not. 

If it includes the p in the answer then p is concatenated in the answer so far string and count remains 0.

Then at (pep|p|0), we further explore the options for character e. 

It has two options, either it can include e in the answer or not. 

If it includes e in the answer then e is concatenated in the answer so far string and count remains 0.

Then at (pep|pe|0), we further explore the options for character p (second p). 

It has two options, either it can include p in the answer or not.

If it includes p in the answer then p is concatenated in the answer so far string and count remains 0.

Since we have reached the end of the string, and the count is 0, therefore, the asf i.e. pep is the first possible output.

Then we come back at (pep|pe|0) and explore the path if the second p is not added in the asf.

In this case, p will not be added in psf and therefore count will become 1.

And again, we have reached the end of the string, but count is 1 this time, therefore, this count will be concatenated at the end of the asf, which will give us the next possible output, pe1.

We have explored both the possibilities via (pep|pe|0) therefore, we go back at (pep|p|0), and see what happens if e was not added to asf.

First of all count becomes 1, and we reach (pep|p|1).

Then at (pep|p|1), we further explore the options for character p (second p). 

It has two options, either it can include p in the answer or not. If p is to be included in the answer then we see that our previous count is not 0, so we concatenate the previous count in the asf and then second p.

Since we have reached the end of the string, and the count is 0, therefore, the asf i.e. p1p is the next possible output.

Then we come back at (pep|p|1) and explore the path if the second p is not added in the asf. In this case, p will not be added in psf and therefore count will become 2.

And again, we have reached the end of the string, but count is 2 this time, therefore, this count will be concatenated at the end of the asf, which will give us the next possible output, p2.

We have explored both the possibilities via (pep|p|1) therefore; we go back at (pep|p|0).

(pep|p|0) has also explored both the options, if "e" were added or not) therefore; we go back at (pep|.|0).

At (pep|.|0), now we explore the possibilities of, if first p were not added in the asf.
If "p" is not added in the answer so far then count becomes 1.

Then at (pep|.|1), we further explore the options for character e. 

It has two options, either it can include e in the answer or not. If it includes e in the answer then e is concatenated with the current count in the answer so far string and count is set to 0.

Then at (pep|1e|0), we further explore the options for character p (second p).

It has two options, either it can include p in the answer or not. If it includes p in the answer then p is concatenated in the answer so far string and count remains 0.

Since we have reached the end of the string, and the count is 0, therefore, the asf i.e. 1ep is the next possible output.


Then we come back at (pep|1e|0) and explore the path if the second p is not added in the asf.
In this case, p will not be added in psf and therefore count will become 1.

And again, we have reached the end of the string, but count is 1 this time, therefore, this count will be concatenated at the end of the asf, which will give us the next possible output, 1e1.

We have explored both the possibilities via (pep|1e|0) therefore, we go back at (pep|.|1), and see what happens if e was not added to asf.

Then at (pep|.|2), we further explore the options for character p (second p). It has two options, either it can include p in the answer or not.

If p is to be included in the answer then we see that our previous count is not 0, so we concatenate the previous count (2) in the asf and then second p.

Since we have reached the end of the string, and the count is 0, therefore, the asf i.e. 2p is the next possible output.

Then we come back at (pep|.|2) and explore the path if the second p is not added in the asf.
In this case, p will not be added in psf and therefore count will become 3.

And again, we have reached the end of the string, but count is 3 this time, therefore, this count will be concatenated at the end of the asf (empty at this stage), which will give us the next possible output, 3.

We have explored both the possibilities via (pep|.|2) therefore; we go back at (pep|.|1).
(pep|.|1) has also explored both the options, if "e" were added or not) therefore; we go back at (pep|.|0).

At (pep|.|0), we have explored both the possibilities that is if first p were not added in the asf.

Let's try to code this!

```
import java.util.*;


public class Main {

  public static void solution(String str, String asf, int count, int pos) {
    if (pos == str.length()) {
      if (count > 0) {
        asf += count;
      }
      System.out.println(asf);
      return;
    }
    solution(str, asf + (count > 0 ? count : "" ) + str.charAt(pos), 0, pos + 1); //yes call -> including curr char
    solution(str, asf, count + 1, pos + 1); //not including curr char -> just converting letters to a number
  }

}
```

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Code Explained:</b></i>

<i><b>Signature of the function:</b></i>

public static void solution (String str, String asf, int count, int pos)

<i><b>str - </b></i>Input string

<i><b>asf - </b></i>String that stores the answer so far, that is till index pos at different levels. 

<i><b>count - </b></i>store the count of characters that were not included in the subsequence just before the pos index. 

<b><i>pos - </b></i>current index.

We will make two calls at each level -

<i><b>Call Yes -</b></i> Include the character at index pos in asf

<i><b>Call No -</b></i> Do not include the character at index pos in asf.

When we make a NO CALL, we increase the pos variable and not include anything in the asf. 

We will also increase the count variable as we are not including the current character in answer.

When we make a YES CALL, we will check whether the count is more than zero. 

If the count is more than zero we will add the count and the character at pos index else we will just add the character at pos index. 

Also, we will make the count variable equal to zero. We are adding the count to the asf as we have to include the characters that we did not add earlier.

We will make a YES call before NO call because of the order of output.

<i><b>Yes Call : </b></i>solution (str, asf + (count > 0 ? count : "" ) + str.charAt(pos), 0, pos + 1);

<i><b>No Call :</b></i> solution (str, asf, count + 1, pos + 1);

<i><b>Base case:</b></i> 

We will return when pos will be equal to length of the string. Before returning we will print the asf. If the count will be greater than zero, we will append the count to the asf before printing it.

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Complexities:</b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity: </b></i>
O(2^N)

Where N = length of the input string. As we are making two calls Yes / No at every index until our pos index is equal to the length of the string, therefore the complexity will be exponential and equal to 2 ^ N.

<i><b>Space Complexity: </b></i>
O(N)

Where N = length of the input string. We can observe that the maximum depth of the recursion tree any time is N. 

Therefore, the max space occupied at any time will be equal to the N. In the post order, the occupied space in the recursion stack will be freed so the space occupied will not exceed N.

```

      System.out.println(asf);
      return;

    solution(str, asf, count + 1, pos + 1);

    Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
    String str = scn.nextLine();
    solution(str, "", 0, 0);
  }
