<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Explanation: </b></i>Problem Explanation: </b></i>

You are given a number n, representing the size of a n * n chess board.

You are required to calculate and print the combinations in which n queens can be placed on the n * n chess-board.

Note, in this problem, you can have any queen in any of the cells, i.e. you are not taking into consideration whether the queens can kill each other or not.

Example:

<i><b>Input: </b></i>Number of queens (n) = 2

<i><b>Output: </b></i>

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach : </b></i>

We have already learnt how to generate combinations of identical items in a 1d array by taking levels as boxes/cells and choices/edges as placing an item or not.

In this problem, we are given the queens as identical items, and there is a slight variation that instead of 1d array of boxes, we are given a 2d array/grid of the chessboard.

So, we will take the cells of the grid as the levels in the recursion tree, and the choice/edge will be whether to place a queen in the cell or let it remain empty.

So, how to traverse through all the cells of the grid as the levels?

We will take the row number and the column number of the cell. There are two possibilities:

If the current cell is the last cell in it's row, then the next cell will be the first cell of the next row, i.e. if the current cell is (r, n-1), then the next cell will be (r + 1, 0).
If the current cell is not the last cell in it's row, then the next cell will be the neighbouring cell in right, i.e. if the current cell is (r, c), then the next cell will be (r, c+1).
Please note what should be the base case of this problem?

<i><b>Base case </b></i>can be considered when we have taken all the cells of the grid in consideration. Please note that the last cell in the recursion tree will be the bottom-right most cell i.e. (n-1, n-1). Hence, the base case can be considered as when the row number becomes n, because the next cell of (n-1, n-1) will be (n, 0) but it does not exist in the grid.

  public static void queensCombinations(int qpsf,
                                        int tq, int row, int col, String asf) {
    if (row == tq) {
      if (qpsf == tq) {
        System.out.println(asf);
      }
      return;
    }
    queensCombinations(qpsf + 1, tq,
                       col == tq - 1 ? row + 1 : row,
                       col == tq - 1 ? 0 : col + 1,
                       col == tq - 1 ? asf + "q

                                          col == tq - 1 ? asf + "-
                                          ": asf + " - ");
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br = new
    BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

    queensCombinations(0, n, 0, 0, "");
  }
}

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Problem Explanation: </b></i>Analysis </b></i>

<i><b>Time Complexity: </b></i>

Since, the recursion tree will grow for at max n^2 depth (where n = number of queens), and at each level, we are having two choices, the overall time complexity will be O(2 * 2 * 2 ... n^2 times) = O(2(n^2))

<i><b>Space Complexity: </b></i>

Since, the maximum depth of recursion is n^2, hence the space complexity will be O(n^2), as recursion takes function call stack space.
