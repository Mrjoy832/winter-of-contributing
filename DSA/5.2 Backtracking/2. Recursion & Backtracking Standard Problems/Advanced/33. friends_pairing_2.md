<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Understanding The Problem: </b></i>

In this problem you are given an integer n, which represents n friends numbered from 1 to n. Each one can remain single or can pair up with some other friend.

All you need to do is to print all the configurations in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.

1.(1) (2) (3)

2.(1) (2,3)

3.(1,2) (3)

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Approach: </b></i>

First of all let us go through the rules:

We cannot make 2 different permutations like 1-2 and 2-1. Only 1-2 is valid.
We will solve this question by recursion and backtracking. At levels, we will place the nth person.

We will explore the options available at the nth level.

For example, for n = 3, we will start from level 1. 1 has the choice to choose from 2 and 3 or be alone. For the next level, 2 will be having the option to choose from 3 or be alone and so on. 

If 1 chooses 2, then 2 will have no choice (as it is already chosen) but to make the call for the next n.

At node pre, we will mark the current friend as visited and at node post we will mark the current friend as unvisited.

When we are at level 1, to choose from 2,3,....n we will use a for loop. Before calling the recursive function in the FOR loop for the next level, we will mark the friend that we want to pair up with as visited (edge pre) and after the calling the recursive, we will unmark that friend (edge post).

<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Signature of the function: </b></i>
```
public static void solution (int i, int n, boolean[] used, String asf){}
```
<i><b>i - </b></i>current level (friend)

<i><b>n - </b></i>user input

<i><b>used - </b></i>an array to store the number which has been used

<i><b>asf - </b></i>string to store the answer till the current level.

Let's try to code this!

```
static int counter = 1;

public static void solution(int i, int n, boolean[] used, String asf) {
  if (i > n) {
    System.out.println(counter + "." + asf);
    counter++;
    return;
  }

  if (used[i]) {
    solution(i + 1, n, used, asf);
  } else {
    used[i] = true;
    solution(i + 1, n, used, asf + "(" + i + ") ");

    for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (used[j] == false) {
        used[j] = true;
        solution(i + 1, n, used,
                 asf + "(" + i + "," + j + ") " );
        used[j] = false;
      }
    }
    used[i] = false;
  }
}
```
<i style="text-decoration:underline"><b>Code Explained: </b></i>

We have two options, whether to pair the current friend or not.
At node pre, we mark the current friend (i) as visited.

<i><b>Option-1: Not pairing the current friend - </b></i> we make a call for the next friend.

<i><b>Option-2:
Pairing the current friend - </b></i> we use a loop from current friend + 1 till n (to avoid permutations). 

If the option has not been paired already, we pair it with the current friend and call the recursive function for the next friend. At edge pre we will mark the options that are valid as visited and at edge post we will mark them as unvisited.

We also have to check whether the current friend (current level) has already been paired before or not. If it has been paired, we will directly call the recursive function for the next friend.

For example - If we pair 2 with 1, then when we call a recursive function for 2, as it has been already paired, we would not do anything for that level and call the recursion function for the next level.

At node post, we will mark the current friend (i) as unvisited.
Base Case: When i will be greater than n, it means that we have made all the pairs for n friends.

To match the way the output is required, we will use a counter and print the asf as the output is required and return.

For better understanding of the code, let's dry run the code for n = 3.

1 will be passed as i in the argument while making a call for the function for n = 3.
1 does not satisfy the base case condition.

Then it's checked whether 1 has been used or not. Since it has not been used earlier, control comes to another part of the code.

As soon as control comes to the else part, the value corresponding to 1 is set true in the used array.

<i><b>Dot call by 1: </b></i>

After that a dot call will be made. By dot call, we mean that, 1 will be alone and added to asf within parenthesis. And a recursive call will be made to an incremented i that is 2.

As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 2.
2 do not satisfy the base case condition.

Then it's checked whether 2 has been used or not. Since it has not been used earlier, control comes to the else part of the code.

As soon as control comes to the else part, the value corresponding to 2 is set true in the used array.

After that a dot call will be made. It means that, 2 will be alone and added to asf((1)) within parenthesis making it ((1)(2)). And a recursive call will be made to an incremented i that is 3.

As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 3.
3 do not satisfy the base case condition.

Then it's checked whether 3 has been used or not. Since it has not been used earlier, control comes to the else part of the code.
As soon as control comes to the else part, the value corresponding to 3 is set true in the used array.

After that a dot call will be made. It means that 3 will be alone and added to asf ((1)(2)) within parenthesis making it ((1)(2)(3)). And a recursive call will be made to an incremented i that is 4.

As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 4.
4 satisfies the base case condition, therefore asf ((1)(2)(3)). is printed, and function is returned.

Control comes back to i = 3 function in the recursion stack.Here, we were done with the dot call.

Now it's time for the 'for' loop.

But since j = 1+i that is 1+3=4 in this case which does not satisfy the for loop condition. Therefore, control now comes to the statement where the value corresponding to 3 is set to false in the used array.

Then control comes back to i = 2 function in the recursion stack.
Here, we were done with the dot call. Now it's time for the 'for' loop.
For loop, for j = i+1 i.e. 2+1=3 which is equal to the given n in this case. Therefore we enter the for loop and check whether the value corresponding to i (2) is false.

If it's false then only we move further otherwise not. Because if it's true, it implies that 'i' has been already used and contributed to asf.
Since it's false, we set it to true.

Then a recursive call is made to 3rd level while updating asf ((1)) with ((23)) and finally making it ((1)(23)).

As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 3.
3 do not satisfy the base case condition.

Then it's checked whether 3 has been used or not. Since it has been used, a cross recursive call is made.

Cross recursive call does not bring add anything to asf only increment the i that is to next level which is 4 in this case.

As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 4.
4 satisfies the base case condition, therefore asf ((1)(23)). is printed, and function is returned.

Control comes back to i = 3 function in the recursion stack. Here, we were done with the cross call.
Then set the value to false in the used array corresponding to 3.

Then control comes back to i = 2 function in the recursion stack.

Here the recursive call inside the 'for' loop for j = 3 has been completed successfully. Then j is incremented to 4, which does not satisfy the for loop condition any more. 

So we come out of the for loop and the value corresponding to 2 is set to false.

Then control comes back to function where i is 1.

"j = 2" call 1:
Then in this function we have just returned from the 'dot call' for i = 1. Now the control enters the for loop when i is 1.

For loop, for j = i+1 i.e. 1+1=2 which is less than given n in this case. 

Therefore we enter the for loop and check whether the value corresponding to i (2) is false.

If it's false then only we move further otherwise not. Because if it's true, it implies that i (2) has already been used and contributed to asf.
Since it's false, we set it to true.

Then a recursive call is made to 2nd level while updating asf with (12).
As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 2.
2 do not satisfy the base case condition.

Then it's checked whether 2 has been used or not. Since it has been used, a cross recursive call is made.

Cross recursive call does not add anything to asf; only increment the i that is to the next level which is 3 in this case.
As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 3.

After that a dot call will be made. It means that 3 will be alone and added to asf ((12)) within parenthesis making it ((12)(3)). And a recursive call will be made to an incremented i that is 4.

As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 4.
4 satisfies the base case condition, therefore asf ((12)(3)). is printed, and function is returned.

Now it's time for the 'for' loop.

But since j = 1+i that is 1+3=4 in this case which does not satisfy the for loop condition. Therefore, control now comes to the statement where the value corresponding to 3 is set to false in the used array.

Then control comes back to i = 2 function in the recursion stack. Here, we were done with the cross call.

Then set the value to false in the used array corresponding to 2.

Then control comes back to i = 1 function in the recursion stack.

Here the recursive call inside the 'for' loop for j = 2 has been completed successfully. Then j is incremented to 3, which satisfies the for loop condition.

"j = 3" call 1:
Then we enter the for loop and check whether the value corresponding to i (3) is false.

If it's false then only we move further otherwise not. Because if it's true, it implies that i (3) has already been used and contributed to asf.
Since it's false, we set it to true.

Then a recursive call is made to 2nd level while updating asf with (13).
As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 2.
2 do not satisfy the base case condition.

Then it's checked whether 2 has been used or not. Since it has not been used earlier, control comes to the else part of the code.

As soon as control comes to the else part, the value corresponding to 2 is set true in the used array.

After that a dot call will be made. It means that, 2 will be alone and added to asf ((13)) within parenthesis making it ((13)(2)). And a recursive call will be made to an incremented i that is 3.

As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 3.

3 do not satisfy the base case condition.
Then it's checked whether 3 has been used or not. Since it has been used, a cross recursive call is made.

Cross recursive call does not bring add anything to asf only increment the i that is to next level which is 4 in this case.

As soon as the call is made, the base case is checked for 4.
4 satisfies the base case condition, therefore asf ((13)(2)). is printed, and function is returned.

Control comes back to i = 3 function in the recursion stack. Here, we were done with the cross call.

Then set the value to false in the used array corresponding to 3.

Then control comes back to i = 2 function in the recursion stack. Here we were done with the dot call.

Then we enter the for loop for j = 3; but 3 has been already marked true here so control does not enter the for loop.
And the for loop does not work for j = 4 as it does not satisfy the loop condition.

So control comes out of the for loop and 2 is set to false in the used array. Then control comes back to function where i is 1.

Here we completed the j call for 3. We set 3 as false in the used array.
Then j is incremented to 4 but the 'for' loop does not run for 4 as it does not satisfy the condition.

So the control comes out of the for loop and then the value corresponding to 1 is set false. (FINALLY!)
